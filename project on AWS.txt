Yes ‚Äî you can absolutely do automatic ML model retraining using **AWS**, and it's actually a very common and production-grade solution. Here‚Äôs how you can do it, based on your use case:

---

## ‚úÖ Goal

Retrain your Bitcoin OHLC XGBoost models **on updated CSV data** every X minutes/hours using AWS services, and **store updated `.pkl` models**.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended AWS Architecture (Simple + Cost-Efficient)

```
            +---------------------------+
            |   btc_ohlc_data.csv       | ‚Üê updated by your system
            |     (in S3 bucket)        |
            +------------+--------------+
                         |
                Trigger every X mins via
                         ‚ñº
            +---------------------------+
            |   AWS Lambda Function     | ‚Üê retrains your model
            |   (or EC2/Batch for heavy)|
            +------------+--------------+
                         |
               Saves model to S3:
                         ‚ñº
            +---------------------------+
            |   model_open.pkl, etc.    | ‚Üê used by FastAPI app
            |     (stored in S3)        |
            +---------------------------+
```

## ‚úÖ 3 Options to Set Up Retraining

### üîπ **Option 1: AWS Lambda (lightweight jobs)**

**Best if** your CSV is small (<50MB) and retraining is fast (XGBoost with small data).

* ‚úÖ **Trigger**: Use **Amazon EventBridge** (cron-style scheduler)
* ‚úÖ **Code**: Train model in Python using `xgboost`, `joblib`
* ‚úÖ **Storage**: Read CSV and write models to **Amazon S3**

> üí° Lambda has 15-min timeout and 10GB memory ‚Äî perfect for light retraining

---

### üîπ **Option 2: AWS Batch or ECS (for heavier workloads)**

**Best if** your dataset or training code is too large for Lambda

* ‚úÖ Dockerize your retraining script
* ‚úÖ Use **AWS Fargate** or **AWS Batch** to run it every hour
* ‚úÖ Write `.pkl` files back to S3

---

### üîπ **Option 3: AWS SageMaker**

**Best if** you want full-fledged ML pipeline with model versioning, monitoring, deployment, etc.

* ‚úÖ Use SageMaker **Processing Jobs** or **Training Jobs**
* ‚úÖ Automatically trigger via **EventBridge**
* ‚úÖ Save models to S3 (or deploy directly from SageMaker)

---

## ‚úÖ Your FastAPI App Can Pull from S3

In your `main.py`, load models like:

```python
import joblib
import boto3
import os

def load_model_from_s3(s3_key, local_path):
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    s3.download_file("your-bucket-name", s3_key, local_path)
    return joblib.load(local_path)

model_open = load_model_from_s3("models/model_open.pkl", "model_open.pkl")
```

You can re-load them periodically or cache in memory.

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Method        | Use Case                           | Notes                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Lambda**    | Light retraining jobs              | Easy to set up, low-cost   |
| **Batch/ECS** | Medium-heavy jobs in Docker        | Better control, more power |
| **SageMaker** | Full ML pipelines & model registry | Powerful but more complex  |

## üîß Want It Done Now?

I can write you:

* The **Lambda code** to retrain on S3 data
* The **FastAPI changes** to load model from S3

Would you like that? And are you using **S3 already** to store your CSV and model files?
